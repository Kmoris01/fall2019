Course Description
------------------

This course is designed for non-programmers, biologists, or those without specific knowledge of Python to learn how to program.
Week by week, we will slowly build up your skills and understanding of computer programming and the Python programming language.
There will be in-class demonstrations, using [JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io), and activities to be completed outside of class, using [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), for you to practice and learn at your own pace.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this course you should be able to:
1. Look at a task and determine if you can or should automate it
2. Create working Python programs
3. Understand the difference between Python object types (e.g. lists, dicts)
4. Perform data analysis and visualization with Python
5. Use [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control and collaboration
6. Demonstrate your Python skills with a project

Communication
------------

Please try to ask your questions during class, if at all possible.

**Before contacting us**, please check to see if your question has already been answered elsewhere, e.g. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

If you cannot find the answer, please make sure to ask your question thoughtfully (https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) and provide everything needed to answer e.g. code, error message, dataset, etc.

In general, please use the [course gitter channel](https://gitter.im/biof309/community) to communicate with classmates and instructors. In case of personal/private question/concerns, please use the private chat functionality of gitter.

In case of an emergency, please use [gitter](https://biof309.slack.com) *and* an email.

Logistics
---------

This is a one-semester course starting on the 12th of September 2019 and finishing in December 2019.

Unless otherwise notified classes will be held at:

** Building 10, Room B1C209-211, NIH Bethesda campus**

Attendance in class is strongly recommended; however, we realize other commitments may occasionally prevent attendance. If you miss a class, please review the materials available at the course [GitHub repository](https://github.com/biof309/fall2019) and keep up with activities and homework.

Forming groups to complete the final project is highly encouraged! 

Required Materials
------------------

**Each student is encouraged to bring their own laptop to each class.**

*Programing without a computer would be an exceptional feat.*



Required software installation
------------------

With a successful install of the required software, you should be able to open the application "Anaconda Navigator", launch a notebook, and execute a cell (Ctrl + Enter) containing the command `!git status`. The indication of success will most likely be an error telling you that your current directory is not a git repository:

`fatal: not a git repostory (or any of the parent directories): .git`

If this is not the case you should follow the instructions below (including instructions specific to your operating system).

Please install the following programs **BEFORE** the first class, you do **not** need admin privileges to do this:
1. The [Anaconda Scientific Python Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

    The Anaconda installer will automatically install most of the software we will use during the course, including [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/Notebook/What%20is%20the%20Jupyter%20Notebook.html).


## OSX (Apple) specific requirements:

1. A working installation of git is required on OSX. Sometimes there is an error on Mac computers where git does not work. This can be resolved by opening the terminal application on OSX and running the command `xcode-select --install` as described [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52522565/git-is-not-working-after-macos-mojave-update-xcrun-error-invalid-active-devel) and selecting "Install".


## Windows

If you use Windows 10, please try to set up the [Windows subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10). This will make things easier.

If this is not possible you can try the following alternative:
1. When installing [gitforwindows](gitforwindows.org) be sure to select the option "Use git and other UNIX tools from the command prompt" when provided options to "Adjust your PATH environment", and take a note of the installation directory. Otherwise install the application with all the default settings.

2. In order to use the software you installed in step 1. within jupyter you need to make a small change to a text file (and you may have to create the text file in the first place). The first option should just work (note though that it assumes that the gitforwindows installed the program "C:\Program Files\Git\bin\bash.exe". If the command below doesn't work you may have to use the second approach and substitute the installation location noted in step 1.)

    + The easiest way to do this is by executing the following command in the "gitbash" application (this will erase pre-existing setup if you have it). Right-click on your mouse is often the way to paste in gitbash. We do not advise attempting to type the command below:
       
       ```if [ ! -d ~/.jupyter ]; then mkdir ~/.jupyter;fi ; curl https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/john/jupyter_notebook.py -o ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py```

    + Another way to configure your installation is to open the file ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py in a text editor and add the line described [here](https://medium.com/@konpat/using-git-bash-in-jupyter-noteobok-on-windows-c88d2c3c7b07)



Optional extras
------------------

We recommend that you avail of the following tools as they will help you in your path towards Pythonic stardom:

1. The [PyCharm Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

    The very nice folks at [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com) have given us free licenses for the Professional Edition of [PyCharm Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), the best (in my humble opinion) Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

    If you have a .edu email address, please install [PyCharm Integrated Development Environment (IDE)](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) Professional using [this link](https://www.jetbrains.com/student/).

    If not, a installation link will be distributed to you by email and made available on [Slack](https://biof309.slack.com/).
    
    Before the first class, please watch the [Getting Started with PyCharm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPC-bGdBSM8&list=PLQ176FUIyIUZ1mwB-uImQE-gmkwzjNLjP) video series.
    
    Before the second class, please watch the [PyCharm In-Depth VCS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFnYQbUZQlA) video series.


2. [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com)

    Since Fall 2017, the very nice folks at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) have been generously supporting our class via their [DataCamp for the Classroom](https://www.datacamp.com/groups/education) initiative.
    
    This program give us free 6 month access to DataCamp's awesome Data VisualizationðŸ“Š, Machine LearningðŸ¤–, and Data Science learning materials.
    
    We will discuss the most interesting examples from DataCamp during class and point out others to be reviewed outside of class.

3. [GitHub](https://github.com/)

    All of the course materials are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
    Before accessing the [course materials repo](https://github.com/biof309/fall2019), you should know that
    * it is likely to be under constant development throughout the semester and
    * you are not expected to work through _everything_ contained therein!

Recommended Books
-----------------
**There is no required textbook for this course.**

We do, however, highly recommend [Python for Data Science](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) and its companion text [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython) by Jake Vanderplas. Both of these books are available free on [GitHub](https://github.com/) in Jupyter Notebook form. The code for [Python for Data Analysis](https://github.com/wesm/pydata-book) by Wes McKinney is also on [GitHub](https://github.com/) but the text is only available in the printed copy of the book. For maximum enjoyment, consider working through the relevant chapters before coming to class.

We will link to relevant online resources throughout the course.

If you would like additional material on the basics, the following resources may be useful:

* [Python for Biologists](http://pythonforbiologists.com/) by Martin Jones.
* [Learn Python the Hard Way (ebook freely available from the author)](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) by Zed A. Shaw; a [video course](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) is also available.

* Documentation

  - Only comments embedded in the code (1-3)
  - Objects and methods have docstrings (4-6)
  - Objects and methods have docstrings, additional standalone documentation (7-9)
  - Objects and methods have docstrings, extensive standalone documentation with example usage (10-12)

* Readability
  - The code is poorly organized and very difficult to read (1-3)
  - The code is readable, but challenging to understand (4-6)
  - The code is fairly easy to read (7-9)
  - The code is well organized and very easy to read (10-12)

* Reusability

  - The code is not organized for reusability (1-3)
  - Some parts of the code could be reused (4-6)
  - Most of the code could be reused (7-9)
  - Each part of the code, and the whole, could be reused (10-12)

* Performance

  - Program does not run (1-6)
  - Program runs, but does not produce correct output (7-12)
  - Program runs, produces correct output under most conditions (13-18)
  - Program runs, produces correct output with robust error checking (19-24)
